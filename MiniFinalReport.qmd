## Project Description

The Chicago Police Department is concern about a the relantionship of crime rates in the District 11. They challenged the Data Insight & Strategy Consultants (DISC) to analizee crime data analysis with elements of human behavior, meteorology, and perhaps, a touch of the mystical. In this project we want to explore innovative approaches to predict and, consequently, reduce the rate of violent crimes within the assigned district. Also, we want to determine if and how various factors influence the rate of violent crimes in Chicago. This will help the Chicago Police Department to plan ahead with public outreach, community events, and other positive means of deterring violent crimes during particularly vulnerable periods.

## Data Acquisition

DISC already provided some collections of datasets, which are the following:

Crimes.csv: This dataset is a detailed record of every crime reported in District 11 in Chicago since 2001, including date, type, location, and outcome. It can be found at https://richardson.byu.edu/data contest/2024/Crimes.csv.

Since weâ€™ll focus specifically on violent crimes, we need to define what's considered a violent crime, we use official definition  found in the FBI and Chicago websites. These can be found at https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/violent-crime#:~:text=Definition,force%20or%20threat%20of%20force. and https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/vrd/home/violence-victimization.html.

2. Weather.csv: Daily weather data since 2010, capturing temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and other meteorological variables. This dataset can be found at https://richardson.byu.edu/data contest/2024/weather.csv.

3. Holidays.csv: A dataset listing major public holidays since 2010. This dataset can
be found at https://richardson.byu.edu/data contest/2024/holidays.csv.

4. Full moon.csv: Contains the dates of all full moons since 2005. This dataset can
be found at https://richardson.byu.edu/data contest/2024/full moon.csv.

Since we noticed the inconsistency of the range in the dates between these datasets we decided to only use from 2010 to 2024.
Being aware of sacrificing 10 years of data, we integrated monthly unemployment data for Chicago. This dataset can be found at

Finally we combined those datasets in order to meticulously structure the count of violent crime by hour along with the other variables such as presence of full moon, daylight status, weather conditions, and social-economic indicators.

## Data Analysis,  Model Building, and Interpretation

Main Model

$y \sim MVN(\textbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}, \sigma^2\textbf{R}({\phi},{\omega}))$, $\textbf{y} = \textbf{X}\mathbf{\beta} + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2R({\phi},{\omega}))$

$\textbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} WHC_{1}\\ WHC_{2}\\ \vdots \\ WHC_{528} \end{bmatrix}$,

$\textbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_{11} & x_{12} \\ 1 & x_{21} & x_{22} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 1 & x_{5281} & x_{5282} \end{bmatrix}$, $\boldsymbol{\beta}= \begin{bmatrix} \beta_{0} \\ \beta_{Yield} \\ \beta_{EC} \end{bmatrix}$,

$\textbf{R} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \rho(s_1,s_2) & \rho(s_1,s_3) & \dots & \rho(s_1,s_{528}) \\ \rho(s_2,s_1) & 1 & \rho(s_2,s_3) & \dots & \rho(s_2,s_{528}) \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & 1 & \rho(s_{527},s_{528}) \\ \rho(s_{528},s_1) & \rho(s_{528},s_2) & \rho(s_{528},s_3) & \dots & 1\end{bmatrix}$, where $\rho(s_i, s_j) = exp\{-\frac{||s_i-s_j||}{\phi}\}$.

Within our model, we have 5 parameters.

-   $\beta_0$ represents the intercept, which is the expected value when all other coefficients within our model are zero.\

-   $\beta_{Yield} \text{ and } \beta_{EC}$ represent the estimated change in WHC when Yield and EC are increased by 1. They are the coefficients of our model.

-   $\sigma^2$ represents the unbiased maximum likelihood for the variance.

-   $\textbf{R}$ represents the correlation matrix between observations from the data, where we have chosen an exponential correlation function.

-   ${\phi}$ represents the parameter used in the exponential correlation calculated from the data.

-   ${\omega}$ represents the variance "nugget" to capture same-location variability.

[Can you add the model that we use and the parameters and stuff here]

#Predictive model


#Implementation of at least four standard supervised machine learning models
We tried a variety of model to get try to get better predictions and compare those results. Indeed, we fit a Random Forest model, Decision Tree, Gradient boosting and KNN model and already mentioned Poisson model.


#Significant or innovative feature engineering

Since we noticed that that time was an important factor, we considered to add generate more variables that can handle the seasonality presented in the data. 

```{python,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data['Month_Sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * data['Month']/12)
data['Month_Cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * data['Month']/12)
data['Day_Sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * data['Day']/data['Date'].dt.days_in_month)
data['Day_Cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * data['Day']/data['Date'].dt.days_in_month)
```

This feature engineering lies in capturing temporal patterns in a way that is more suitable for machine learning models, like this Random Forest. By encoding months and days as cyclical features, the model can understand their cyclic nature and learn patterns effectively, such as monthly or daily seasonality which is present in the crime data because of weather and another factors.

#An exploration of variable importance using SHAP

As we mentioned before, we used a Decision Tree to understand better the factors that impact the count of violent crime.
```{python, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=20, random_state=42)

# Fit the model
rf_model.fit(X, y)

# Get feature importances
feature_importances = rf_model.feature_importances_

# Map feature names to their respective importances
feature_importance_map = dict(zip(X.columns, feature_importances))

# Sort the features by importance
sorted_features = sorted(feature_importance_map.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Extract top 25 features
top_features = sorted_features[:25]
```

We kind of expecting that that temperature will be an important factor, so we will check with SHAP as well to understand the impact of features on model predictions.
```{python, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=20, random_state=42)

# Fit the model
rf_model.fit(X, y)

# Get feature importances
feature_importances = rf_model.feature_importances_

# Map feature names to their respective importances
feature_importance_map = dict(zip(X.columns, feature_importances))

# Sort the features by importance
sorted_features = sorted(feature_importance_map.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Extract top 25 features
top_features = sorted_features[:25]
```

#Cluster analysis OR anomaly detection
Also we wanted to apply cluster analysis to understand patterns or groups in how these factors correlate with crime rates
