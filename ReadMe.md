# Introduction

Violent crime in Chicago remains a persistent challenge. For the 2024 BYU Statistics Case Study Competition, the Chicago Police Department (CPD), particularly concerned about the situation in District 11, has partnered with Data Insight & Strategy Consultants (DISC) to explore innovative approaches. This project delves beyond traditional methods, incorporating human behavior, weather patterns, and even the lunar cycle, to analyze crime data and uncover potential predictors.

Our goal is to determine if and how these factors influence violent crime rates in Chicago. This knowledge will empower the CPD to proactively implement crime prevention strategies, such as public outreach and community events, during particularly vulnerable periods. By shedding light on the potential relationships between these factors and crime, we aim to make Chicago a safer place for all.
